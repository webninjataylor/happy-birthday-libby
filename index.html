			In preparation for our eventual trip to Scotland to celebrate your 40th birthday, and because you love history, I created this interactive web page filled with 40 Scottish fun facts.
		</p>
		<p>
			The cards you see below begin as the Scottish Royal Rampant Lion and switch to the Scottish St Andrew's Cross when they are available for viewing.  I timed it so a new one will be avialable every three hours starting at 12:00 AM on November 1 with the final card being ready at 9:00 PM on your birthday for a total of 40 cards (clever, eh?).  Click or tap a flag to reveal a Scottish fun fact.  But that's not all! Click again to see an adorable photo of you!  Thanks to your mom, you'll see a photo from each year of your life, just like the one above (the page looks really cute when they're all displayed at once)!  You can then flip back and forth between your photo and the Scottish fun fact.  Your browser will remember the cards you've viewed, but will always reload as the photos of you (just click or tap again to reread the fact).  If you go to a new device or browser the cards will all be flags again, but the timer still works along the main timeline I mentioned.
